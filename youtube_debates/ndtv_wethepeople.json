        "description": "According to the World Health Organisation, India is the most depressed country in the world with 36 per cent of citizens battling depression or other mental health issues. Suicide is the leading cause of death among young people. Adding to the grim picture is the almost negligible size of mental health care sector with just three psychiatrists per million Indians. On this edition of We The People, we ask: Is it time we acknowledged the existence of a looming threat to India's young demographic in the form of severe mental crises? Can a measly expenditure of 0.06% of the health budget tackle this growing menace?\n\nWatch full video: https://www.ndtv.com/video/news/we-the-people/mental-health-in-india-toss-the-taboo-469004?yt\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

        "description": "It is estimated that in India, a woman dies every two hours because of unsafe abortions. Just 10 per cent of the estimated 70 lakh abortions that happen in India every year are said to be documented; the rest are assumed to take place in shady clinics, often run by quacks. In a landmark ruling in September, the Supreme Court of India allowed a 13-year-old rape victim in Mumbai to terminate her 31-week pregnancy. Yet the same court in July ruled that a 10-year-old raped child, should not be allowed to abort at 28 weeks. On We The People we ask: Why did the families of these children have to go to the court for a private decision? And, is it time for the 46-year-old Indian abortion law to be amended?\n\nWatch full video: https://www.ndtv.com/video/news/we-the-people/abortion-laws-caught-in-a-time-warp-468475?yt\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare and MM Kalburgi, all rationalists and free thinkers in their own right, were killed in a manner eerily similar to Gauri Lankesh and the perpetrators are yet to be brought to book. On this episode of We The People, we ask: Was Gauri's killing ideologically motivated or is speculation about the killers doing disservice to the investigation? What does this murder mean for freedom of speech in India ?

While one side led by non-profits RIT Foundation and AIDWA is asking the court to declare marital rape a crime, the opposing party led by another non-profit Men's Welfare Trust is against the idea representing fears that the law could be misused. The government's stand is that criminalising marital rape may lead to \"destabilisation of marriages\". On this edition of We The People, we ask: What is more important, tradition or women's rights? Does the idea of consent become impotent after marriage?

In May this year, a CAG report had warned of glaring technical shortages with many hospitals in the country including the hospital in question.

All religions, castes, classes, ages and genders came together to fight for their freedom. Ironically, the free India of the 21st century continues to bicker over the definition of nationalism. On this episode of We The People, we ask: are symbols like war tanks and national flags enough to instill nationalism in the citizens? Does a diverse country of 1.2 billion people work better with diverse ideas of nationalism? Who decides what the definition of nationalism is? Shouldn't people in a democracy be free to choose their individual form of nationalism?\n\nWatch full video: http://www.ndtv.com/video/news/we-the-people/we-the-people-who-is-a-patriot-and-who-gets-to-decide-465254?yt\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

The abuse often ranges from withholding of wages to starvation, not allowing time for sleep or rest, beatings, torture, and even sexual exploitation.

        "description": "Since 2014, there has been a deluge of opposition leaders who have found home in the BJP, six Congress MLAs from Gujarat being the latest. The BJP now has governments in 18 out of 29 states. With Nitish deserting the RJD and joining hands with the BJP in Bihar, the Opposition seems to have lost the one face that could have led them against the BJP in 2019. On this episode of We The People, we ask: with Congress leaders critical of their central leadership, is it time for the Grand Old Party to seek change at the top? Is Nitish's new-found camaraderie with the BJP going to cost the Opposition a respectable chance in the next general elections? Is 2019 a won battle for the BJP?\n\nWatch full show: http://www.ndtv.com/video/news/we-the-people/we-the-people-2019-elections-sealed-for-pm-modi-464132?yt\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

According to the government, there have been 11,400 farmer suicides in 2016. In 2013-14, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had committed to doubling farmer incomes in the next 5 years. But despite such high-level political commitments, progress on the ground has sadly been lacking for decades.

His visit to Israel earlier this week, the first ever by an Indian Prime Minister in a departure from the traditional Israel-Palestine policy, signals that India under PM Modi's leadership is not afraid to explore unconventional relationships if they eventually serve the country's needs. That being said, the recent India-China standoff in Doklam proves that India may need to prioritise its relations with its neighbours over the rest of the world. On We The People, we ask: Is India making new friends in the Global North at the cost of its relationships with its immediate neighbours? Have the Prime Minister's many foreign visits resulted in substantial gains for the country? Does India have an opportunity to fill in the void between an unsure US and an unpredictable China?\n\nWatch full video: http://www.ndtv.com/video/news/we-the-people/we-the-people-modi-fied-foreign-policy-optics-vs-outcome-462398?yt\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

The army has been sent in along with the paramilitary forces to try and restore law and order. Three protesters have died, one policeman has been stabbed.

        "title": "Walk The Talk With World Economic Forum Founder Klaus Schwab",
        "description": "\"People's mindset has changed globally and the world though more dangerous is now better\" - a puzzling comment by the Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum and a renowned economist Prof Klaus Schwab. This remark becomes lucid when he explains that globalisation has got the world closer and encouraged risk taking but at the same time excessive risk does lead to economic crises. Professor Schwab is optimistic that US President Donald Trump will reverse his decision of the US quitting the Paris Climate Change Agreement. On Walk The Talk this week, watch the eminent economist voice his opinion on various issues including how Europe will handle Brexit and whether India can become a global economic giant, courtesy Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nWatch full show: http://www.ndtv.com/video/shows/walk-the-talk/walk-the-talk-with-world-economic-forum-founder-klaus-schwab-461025?yt\n\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

Body shaming is a practice of humiliating people by making critical comments about their physical appearance. On this edition of We The People, the question is, who gets to decide if someone is fit or not? Is the obsession with weight and colour fair? Have we gone way too far under the pressure of looking \"perfect\"?\n\nWatch full video: http://www.ndtv.com/video/news/we-the-people/we-the-people-body-shaming-unfair-and-ugly-459856?yt\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

In response, Delhi's Jantar Mantar witnessed a major Dalit rally on May 21st, against the alleged violence by upper caste Thakurs. At Jantar Mantar, thousands of Dalit protesters gathered under the banner of Bhim Army to protest against the atrocities they faced. On this edition of We The People, we ask: Is Yogi government failing to ensure its crime-free state promise? Have mainstream Dalit political fronts lost their ground? Is Dalit affirmation taking the centre stage?

        "description": "With two Indian soldiers mutilated in Poonch, the country, and not just the government is livid. And yet again, the government has issued strong statements. While the Sports Minister has said that terror and sports don't go along, a delegation of 50 Pakistani students was sent back on the advice of the Foreign Ministry. Clearly the cultural ties with Pakistan have taken a severe beating. But is severing cultural ties the answer? The Indian Army has obliquely hinted at military reaction at the time and place of its choosing. In response to the claims of beheading of Indian soldiers by the Indian Army, the Pakistan Army has denied any such occurrence. On this edition of We The People we ask: Can India do better? Is there anything we can do other than diplomatic statements, surgical strikes, and banning Pakistani players and artists from the country? These actions might satisfy public anger in the immediate term, but do they actually advance India's long term interest?\n\nWatch full video: http://www.ndtv.com/video/news/we-the-people/we-the-people-a-problem-called-pakistan-456539?yt\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

        "description": "On April 24, 25 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force or CRPF were killed in an attack by the Maoists. The attack came a month after 12 CRPF jawans were killed in a similar ambush on March 11. Maoists even stole 10 weapons from the dead troopers. In 2010, 75 CRPF troopers were killed in Dantewada in the heart of the so called \"red corridor\". On this episode of We The People, we are asking: Has the CRPF borne the brunt of India's decades-long battle with Maoists? Are our security forces sitting ducks in the hands of the Maoists? Are more boots on the ground the way forward? And, with 2017 marking the 50th anniversary of the Naxal movement,  do we need to rethink and reevaluate the strategy to deal with the Naxals?\n\nWatch full video: http://www.ndtv.com/video/news/we-the-people/we-the-people-how-should-india-deal-with-maoists-455898?yt\n\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

        "description": "The Kashmir Valley is on the boil once again. The Srinagar by-polls on April 9 recorded the lowest ever turnout of 7.13%. The polling took place amidst widespread violence and arson resulting in nine deaths. The unrest is just as palpable on social media as it is on the ground and both seem to be feeding into each other. On one hand we have a video showing a CRPF jawan being heckled at a polling booth, on the other we have a civilian being used as a human shield by the Army. On this edition of We The People, we ask: How did we get here? Did governments, both at the Centre and the state, wither away dividends of peace after the unrest of 2010 subsided? Why are more and more Kashmiri youngsters turning to militancy? And does the Modi government have a roadmap for peace in the troubled Valley? Is dialogue with all stakeholders the only way out of this violent and long-drawn stalemate?\n\nWatch full video: http://www.ndtv.com/video/news/we-the-people/the-kashmir-conundrum-how-did-we-get-here-455335?yt\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

But in the last three years, we have seen a combination of judicial and executive action at state and central levels, many of which have been accused of infringing people's personal liberty. Elements of the government are trying to control what we eat, drink, watch and even speak. After BJP's recent victory in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the re-emergence of anti-Romeo squads and increased brazenness of 'gau-rakshaks' or cow vigilantes have raised many questions.

In our homes and on our screens, there's no better way to bring large families together for celebrations that are often our greatest memories of a lifetime. But behind the celebrations lies a darker story. In most cases, given India's poverty levels, the festivities impose a crushing burden on the hosts. There is enormous pressure to host as lavish a wedding as possible. People save for a life-time, to throw that one big party - and often these savings are not enough. Many become deeply indebted as a result of wedding festivities. Today on We The People ask: is it time to trim the big fat Indian wedding? Or Is this too great an intrusion on personal liberty?\n\nWatch full video: http://www.ndtv.com/video/news/we-the-people/we-the-people-big-fat-indian-wedding-time-to-tone-it-down-453482?yt\n\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

The ruling Samajwadi Party who went into the polls in alliance with Congress has taken a bashing while Mayawati's BSP, which was considered the dark horse, has been obliterated.

Is it time Congress looked for a new leadership?

While Right to Education is a fundamental right, in reality, India offers education of acceptable quality only to those who can pay for it. Multiple studies have highlighted miserable quality of education in our \n\ngovernment schools. One in six teaching positions in government schools are vacant. So are private schools the answer?
