In a similar fashion, a rumour about some mysterious person cutting off the hair locks of women when they are asleep emanated from Bikaner and has now spread to Haryana, Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh. Several people have begun reporting that their hair was cut off during sleep by some person or 'spirit'. Ravish Kumar discusses this ongoing panic mongering caused in the context of how fake news can create chaos when there are no checks to prevent it from spreading.

        "description": "As we tour through Seemapuri – a congested slum in north-east Delhi, we find that drug and substance abuse are a way of life here. At every corner we find children injecting drugs into their veins or inhaling intoxicating substances. Some of the youth we spoke to say that relapse is very common owing to the easy availability of addiction causing drugs at extremely cheap rates. Children in this slum earn money for buying drugs by picking trash and selling them to scrap dealers. Some engage in crimes to fund their needs for drugs.

Prime Time today discusses how social media posts lead to violence and rioting and asks whether political parties are contributing to escalating tensions instead of helping curb the tension. While chief minister Mamata Banerjee has blamed the BJP for the violence, the BJP on the other hand says that the situation is a fallout of Ms Banerjee's 'Muslim appeasement'.
