According to sources, the 33-year-old had just returned home to Hajin town of Bandipore for a vacation a few days ago. He was dragged out of his home and shot dead, officials said, adding that it looks to be a targeted killing. Jammu and Kashmir DGP, SP Vaid, told News18 that there were 3-4 terrorists who barged into the home of the BSF jawan. He said their attempt was to take Parray away, but they shot him multiple times at close range when he resisted. He died on the spot. The terrorists also fired indiscriminately at the family, injuring the jawan’s father, two brothers and an aunt. The DGP said that the jawan’s father was with a faction of the Hurriyat and this could be a revenge attack. Police said that the injured family members have been taken to a hospital. The condition of the jawan’s aunt was stated to be serious, while that of the three others was stable.IG Police, Muneer Khan, said that a manhunt has been launched to nab the terrorists. The entire area has been cordoned off and is being searched, he said. The modus operandi followed by terrorists in the killing of Parray is very similar to the one in the murder of Lt. Ummer Fayaz in May this year, suggesting a concerted plan of targeted killings. Just like Fayaz, Parray too was a local who had joined the security forces and had recently returned home. The bullet-ridden body of Army Lieutenant, Ummer Fayaz, was found at Herman Chowk of Jammu and Kashmir’s Shopian district. The 24-year-old had gone to Shopian to attend the wedding function of a relative.

The GDP has witnessed a steady decline as India faces structural problems in the implementation of big bang reforms such as the GST and demonetisation. Has the government done too much, too soon? Or is this a passing phase that will only make the economy stronger? On this week's episode of The Big Fight, we look at the top five reasons behind the economic slowdown.

      "Big Fight with Vikram Chandra | Simultaneous Polls: Aye Or Nay?:::On this week's episode of The Big Fight, we debate whether holding simultaneous elections is a good idea or not. What does 'simultaneous elections' mean? Niti Aayog defines it as follows: It involves the structuring of Indian election cycle in a manner that elections to Lok Sabha and State Assemblies are synchronized together. In such a scenario, a voter would normally cast their vote for electing members of Lok Sabha and State Assembly on a single day and at the same time.The idea is not new to India and has recently seen favour with both the Prime Minister and the President of the BJP. Will holding simultaneous elections help curb corruption, will it also reduce election expenditure and black money or is the idea too Utopian to be implemented in a democracy like India?

      "The Big Fight On Dynastic Politics:::On a recent visit to America, Congress Vice President, Rahul Gandhi insinuated that dynastic politics not only works in India but it is what people prefer. On this episode of The Big Fight, we debate whether there is any truth in that statement. A quick glance at the current Lok Sabha proves that Congress is by far the most dynastic of all parties with as many as 48% of its MPs from political families. BJP on the other hand, has that number limited to 15%, as both the Prime Minister and the BJP President are not from political parties. In India, the hard reality is that dynasties perpetuate in most if not all major political parties in India. What are the repercussions of this? Does dynastic politics deplete or add to the pool of talent in the legislature? And its not just politics, a majority of big ticket companies in India are also family owned. Does this prove beyond doubt that Indians prefer dynasts over those with merit?

      "Should NRIs Be Allowed To Vote Through Proxies?:::Last month, the government took a decision to allow non-resident Indians or NRIs to nominate a proxy to vote in elections. The condition is that both the NRI and the proxy should be from the same constituency and the choice is only confined to elections. While the Parliament is yet to take up the matter and allow it, critics, including former Chief Election Commissioners, have expressed concern that it would violate the model code of secret ballots. If indeed proxy voting is deemed fit to be implemented, then shouldn't the same rule apply to migrants? It should be borne in mind that NRIs already have a legitimate right to vote which was bestowed to them during UPA-II. The only bone of contention was to figure out the modalities. It's true that NRIs have been the flagbearers of Indian culture for decades -- particularly in the US, Gulf countries and in Western Europe, but of late they have been playing an important role in promoting India in their country of residence backed by their growing financial clout. But will proxy voting disrupt the process of voting in India? Will an NRI, notwithstanding their love for their motherland, be able to make judicious choice of selecting the 'right' candidate based on his/her performance without being swayed by party manifestos and ideologies?Watch full video: http://www.ndtv.com/video/news/the-big-fight/should-nris-be-allowed-to-vote-through-proxies-466817?ytNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

From being the poster boy of poverty and branded as a land of snake-charmers, India has come a long way. Cynics had doubted whether India would even survive even for a few years with its experiment of being a democratic country amidst a wide range of diversity - religious, linguistic, racial to name a few. Though India has pulled out millions of people from the scourge of poverty, yet several millions still go to bed hungry.

The dream of weaving a grand coalition is now in tatters - with the loss of a clean, competent, credible face - now back in National Democratic Alliance's fold, the BJP's job for 2019 polls appears more than half done.  But is it so? Can the BJP increase its tally beyond 282 seats that they got in 2014 general elections? In the last general election, BJP swept Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and reduced the opposition to a few seats in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh. It's really difficult to increase its seats from these states. If NDA has to increase its tally it must look at those states where its performance was way below even satisfactory level - West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala - where BJP won a paltry five seats out of 120. However, political experts believe that it is not the electoral arithmetic that works in India but rather the mood of the people, the 'wave' or the lack of it, that decides the outcome. No doubt, as of today, NDA under PM Narendra Modi is in an advantageous position and the opposition is grappling to figure out ways to counter him.

Today in India, where sane voices taking middle ground on the issues of communalism, terrorism and nationalism are being drowned in the cacophony of social media trolls, the discourse is increasingly being shaped by extreme voices. This was more evident in the recent events that rattled the nation - from the attack on Amarnath pilgrims in Kashmir to the communal riots in Basirhat, West Bengal. While the right-wing accused the \"liberals\", \"Leftists\", civil society and mainstream media of selective outrage, the \"liberals\" responded by blaming the right-wing brigade of stoking the communal fire, of deliberately blaming the minority community and posting fake news to justify the cause. Are we entering a new era of polarisation? Is there a justification in the charge labelled by right-wingers against civil society and liberals of selective outrage?

GST will ensure smooth flow of goods between states which were so far subjected to a slew of taxes often holding up trucks and containers ferrying goods causing inordinate delay.

But what rarely comes out is that the population of senior citizens is also growing at a brisk pace - more than 36 per cent according to census data between 2001 and 2011. The ageing population tragically is being accompanied with its unfortunate elements of loneliness, abuse, neglect and a rise in number of cases of geriatrics. But this was not the case. The rise of nuclear families has cut the support system which used to sustain and form a support group for the elderly is slowly being eroded and the rising cost of healthcare and frailties are forcing them to take succor at old-age homes. Less than 30 per cent of senior citizens have a pension cover and the increase lifespan is making it even more difficult for them to be financially independent.

For all the semi-skilled or unskilled workers, the situation is really problematic. Will they depend on government doles for day-to-day existence? The Modi government had placed a lot of emphasis on skill development but the lack of a strong education base and low industry demand is affecting their prospect. The industry, while admitting the changing scenario, is looking for niche skills - nano technologists, experts on robotics, high-end researchers, experienced managers in assembly line production but our education sector has been unable to keep pace with the changing demand. According to an Ernst & Young and FICCI study, over 80 percent of India's engineering graduates and around 90 percent of MBAs are unemployable. It's high time that we completely overhauled our education system.

      "3 Years Of NaMo: Hits And Misses:::Change was the catchphrase in the run up to 2014 polls. Narendra Modi had promised us that he will transform India, end corruption, bring in industry, generate jobs, end social strife and forge a new path with neighbours and word powers. With his emphatic victory in the polls people were buoyed with the hope of a transformation that would herald a new era and catapult India towards a path of development. Three years have passed since Narendra Modi was anointed as the Prime Minister of the country. While the government has certainly succeeded in bringing down inflation, tackling corruption its failure to generate enough jobs has invited criticism from all quarters. While electorally, BJP had its best performance in Jammu and Kashmir, the sharp slide in the internal security condition of the state has put several question marks over its inability to come up with a new strategy to deal with the impending crisis.While time and again, PM Modi has reiterated his mantra of 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas', the highhandedness of Gau Rakshaks and other fringe groups have undermined the government's desire to take along all sections of the society. The realm of foreign policy has been really tricky for this government. With a changing geo-political scenario the government has been grappling with new ways and strategies - especially when it comes to Pakistan and China. While India's relation with Bangladesh and Nepal has improved a series of flip flops with Pakistan and China's belligerence stance and disregard for India's security concerns have hemmed in the Modi government into a corner. China has blocked India's entry to NSG and vetoed UN sanctions against terrorist Masood Azhar. It seems that it will be a long winding road for India.

For India, unfortunately placed in a complicated neighbourhood amidst a complex relationship with two of its biggest neighbours - Pakistan and China - a long-term policy to deal with the neighbours is missing. India's piecemeal approach based on managing situations rather than long-term plan to resolve issues is not helping our strategic interest. Does India have a game-plan to counter China-Pak axis? Does it have enough diplomatic leverage to prevent the construction of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor that passes through Pak-Occupied Kashmir?

The demolition was followed by riots across the country with hundreds of people losing their lives in the communal frenzy. Recently the Supreme Court said that Lal Krishna Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti should be tried for criminal conspiracy. Mr Advani, however, has time and again denied being responsible for bringing the mosque down. He even went to the extent of describing the day, when the mosque was brought down, as the 'saddest day' of his life.

In March this year the Court had refused to intervene in the Ayodhya dispute case suggesting amicable solution between the two warring factions. While there are a considerable number of cases where the Judiciary's intervention has been sought and lauded there are some cases where its intervention has been questioned - most notably the day-to-day running of BCCI.

However, activists are in favour of the Court's intervention vis-a-vis subversion of fundamental rights - like access to food, healthcare, issues farm distress.

Are the poll reforms, vesting more powers on Income Tax officers, making Aadhaar mandatory for filing I-T returns and making sweeping changes to Appellate Tribunals a subversion of constitution? The government, in its defence, is falling back to previous UPA and NDA regimes where poll reforms were tagged along the Finance Bill.

But most importantly, why is it so that while thousands of citizens stand in queues, waiting to withdraw their hard earned money, our television screens flash hoards of new cash being seized from all across the country? Has black money wriggled its way back into the system? As we take stock of the situation, we revisit the six crucial questions we asked in our last episode - Will this lead to windfall gains for the government? What will happen with the banks? Will there be a budget bonanza? Will black money be blacked out? Will the generation of black black money be curtailed in the future? And finally, how long will this disruption continue? As the weeks pass and time closes in on the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 50-day promise, we see if our experts still hold the same opinion that they did when the PM's scheme was first announced on November 8th.Watch full video: http://www.ndtv.com/video/news/the-big-fight/the-big-fight-notes-ban-a-big-success-or-massive-failure-442788?ytDownload the NDTV news app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.july.ndtv&referrer=utm_source%3Dyoutubecards%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dyoutube:::2016-12-17\n",

      "The Big Fight: Is There A Threat To Liberal Democracy?:::2016 hasn't been as sweet as the year had promised to be. It saw the 'unexpected' severance of Britain with the European Union; it saw the world's most powerful democracy elect a politically divisive Donald Trump as their 45th President. Were these events really 'unexpected'? Perhaps not. Then how did we not see it coming? Aren't journalists, the people you watch on your television screens every single night meant to 'shape' your opinions? Aren't pollsters supposed to keep their ears to the ground? How could this majority be left unheard for so long? Did the frontrunners of this liberal democracy have ideological blinkers on? Did they miss the signs as they marched forward? Or did they get too comfortable in our little bubble of enfranchisement and entitlement? Are these mere 'events' or symptoms of a larger problem? The repercussions are here for all of us to live through. It's not a crowd of a handful of bigots, ranting at the local town square as the 'politically correct' squirm in embarrassment. It's an entire population, that is responding to the isolating impact of globalisation, it's an entire population that still hasn't come to terms with the loss of their identity in this 'mixed' world, it's an entire population that is standing up for its voice to be heard by the elites, sitting in ivory towers, with their heads up in the clouds. This moment perhaps marks the dilution of an elitist discourse at the hands of a populist one? With this shrill a pitch, is democracy in peril?

      "#CashCleanup: Note Worthy Or Not Worthy?:::More than a week has passed since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his big-bang strike on black money by banning notes of higher denominations. The aam aadmi had wholeheartedly welcomed the idea initially, but with hardships and inconvenience increasing, people are questioning if there was proper planning before the announcement of this watershed move. The informal sectors have been hit the worse - local shopkeepers, vegetable vendors, small farmers, landless labourers and those working on construction sites. With the cash crunch affecting the economy, will the government show the same alacrity in ensuring that money reaches those who live on the margins of the society? Because if the ground situation doesn't improve, the move might politically backfire for the BJP and political parties like the Aaam Aadmi Party, the Trinomool Congress, the Samajwadi Party are leaving no stone unturned in criticising the government for its frailties in executing the plan. The experts on both side of the political divide are unanimous on one thing - this grand move has to be followed by a crackdown on corruption, more tax reforms and bringing in regulation in the real estate sector. Will the government tread this uncharted waters and walk the talk? Or a year or two from now, people will remember the hardships that they faced the cash crunch that made them anxious with little or no benefit that accrued from this move? Will this go down in history as the big-bang move that will rid India of its black money or will it turn out to be a damp squib?Watch full video: http://www.ndtv.com/video/news/the-big-fight/cashcleanup-note-worthy-or-not-worthy-439376?ytDownload the NDTV news app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.july.ndtv&referrer=utm_source%3Dyoutubecards%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dyoutube:::2016-11-20\n",

The game could still flip but the least it ensures a real shot at winning the match. And that is exactly what the Modi government has done. Having completed exactly half term at two years six months this November, Narendra Modi has sealed this milestone with a master stroke. A quintessential, Modi style attack on black money. All those stashing cash at home, that includes your local kirana wallah, the vegetable vendor, the property agent, the real estate developer, the jeweller, the small businessman, even the householder who saved up small stacks of money for the rainy day, quivered with awe and disbelief. The fishing net had been lowered just enough to catch the small fish. There was panic and anxiety too, as the coming days saw shop owners refuse old 500, 1000 rupee notes, COD or cash on delivery declined as cashless payment companies sprung into actions with payment codes appearing in even tea-stalls. The shrewd Indian brain sprang into action, coming up with innovative ways or jugaad to convert black into white. But what does this really mean for the economy at large? How much cash will the government be able to accumulate through this new move? Can this move be linked to the upcoming elections in UP and Punjab?

Small yet meaningful measures such as vacuuming of roads, sprinkling of water was not done.

The brand ambassadors of the product, actors Amitabh Bachchan, Madhuri Dixit and Preity Zinta were not only flayed on social media but a case was filed against them in a local court in Uttar Pradesh. The case rested on the logic that celebrities should be held accountable for any product they endorse, since the celebrities, have a mass following and have the ability to sway people. The discourse on making celebrities accountable for misleading adverts was given a shot in the arm when the Parliamentary Standing Committee made recommendations on making celebrities accountable. Based on which, the government has prepared a draft Bill proposing criminal liabilities on celebrities featuring in misleading advertisements. It says that court can take 'cognisance' of a false or misleading endorsement if the complaint is being filed by an officer of the Central Consumer Protection Authority. Though the draft bill makes it clear that consumers won't be able to drag a celebrity to court yet the endorsers are up in arms as they say that it is impossible to validate the claims made by the manufacturers since only an expert is qualified to exercise such due diligence.

India received tremendous support from its neighbours especially from SAARC countries, which has pushed Pakistan into a corner. The US, while remaining silent on the strikes, has called on Pakistan to act against terror outfits. So what will Pakistan do now - live in denial about the surgical strikes and blame India for fanning the flame in Balochistan or wait for an opportunity to carry out another terror strike in India through its proxies whom they refer as 'non-state actors'?
